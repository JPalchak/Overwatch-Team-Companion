Until I do further testing, install this environment using Conda (Python 3.6 version)

https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

After installation, you can create a new environment with the required dependencies using:

1. Open command prompt and navigate to this app's directory (overwatch-python)
2. Create a conda environment using "conda env create -f conda_environment.yml"
3. Activate the new environment: "activate OverwatchApp"
4. Start the app: "pythonw overwatch_app.py"

After the initial setup, you only need to do steps 1,3, and 4
